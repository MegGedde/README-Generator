# Professional README Generator Starter Code

## Description
This repository will generate a README file according to user inputs.

## Questions
You will be taken through multiple command line questions that will come together to form your readme. These questions will include a title, description, installation, usage, license, contributing, tests and contact information including email and github. This will also auto-generate a table of contents. 

Here is an example:
